Metadata

``rez-pip`` does its best to convert the `PyPA core metadata`_ into rez's metadata.

It is able to to convert most of the `PyPA core metadata`_:

* Name
* Version
* Summary
* Description
* Author
* Author-email
* Maintainer
* Maintainer-email
* License
* Home-page
* Project-URL
* Download-URL

.. _PyPA core metadata: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/

Name
====

Link: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#name

Stored in ``name``.

.. warning::
   ``-`` and ``.`` will be converted to ``_`` and the name will be lowercased.
   We replace ``-`` because it is the separator that rez uses to differentiate
   a package name from a version. We replace ``.`` because ``ruamel.yaml`` and
   ``ruamel_yaml`` are considered the same in the Python ecosystem (this is just
   an example). And we lowercase the name because again, the Python ecosystem
   is case insensitive when it comes to package names.

Version
=======

Link: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#name

Stored in ``version``. Versions will be converted from :pep:`440` format to
a rez compatible format.

Summary
=======

Link: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#summary

Stored in ``summary`` as is.

Description
===========

Link: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#description

Stored in ``description`` as is.

Author and Maintainer
=====================

Links:

* https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#author
* https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#maintainer

Appended to ``authors`` as is.

Author-email and Maintainer-email
=================================

Links:

* https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#author-email
* https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#maintainer-email

Each email is appended to ``authors`` as is.

License
=======

Link: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#license

If present, it will be stored as in a custom attributed called ``license`` as is.

If not present, ``rez-pip`` will look into `classifiers`_ for any value that starts with ``License ::``.
If one is found, it will be used as the license. If more than one is found, ``license`` will not be set.

.. _classifiers: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#classifier-multiple-use


Home-page
=========

Link: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#home-page

Appended to ``help`` like this:

.. code-block::

   help = [
       ['Home-page', 'https://example.com']
   ]

Project-URL
===========

Link: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#project-url-multiple-use

Project URLs are appended to ``help``. For example, if a package defines

.. code-block::

   {
       'Documentation': 'https://example.com/docs',
       'Source': 'https://example.com/source'
   }

it will be converted to:

.. code-block::

   help = [
       ['Documentation', 'https://exmaple.com/docs'],
       ['Source', 'https://example.com/source']
   ]

Download-URL
============

Link: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#download-url

Appended to ``help`` like this:

.. code-block::

   help = [
       ['Download-URL', 'https://example.com/download']
   ]

Extra metadata added by rez-pip
===============================

``rez-pip`` will add a ``pip`` attribute in the installed package definitions.

.. code-block::

   pip = {
       "name": "",
       "version": "",
       "is_pure_python": "",
       "wheel_url": "",
       "rez_pip_version": "",
       "metadata": {}
   }

The definition for the fields is described in the table bellow.

=============== ==============
Attribute       Description
=============== ==============
name            Original name of the package
version         Original version
is_pure_python  Is the package a pure python package?
wheel_url       URL of the wheel downloaded and installed
rez_pip_version Version of rez-pip used to create the package
metadata        All metadata that was not converted will be stored in this field
=============== ==============
